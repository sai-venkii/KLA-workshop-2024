### My Notes:
* Initial Intuition: Problem appears similar to Job scheduling in OS. Check Gantt Chart. 
* Threading? - Turns out to be Complex
* For dependency - Try Topo sort

### Todo:
* Models - Completed
* Parsing - Completed
* Output Handling - Completed
* Topo Sort - Completed
* Fluctuations - Completed
* Further Optimization - Current!!

### Code info:
* processWafer, processMachines, processStepData are used to parse the given data in json file into respective Models
* Three Dictionaries are used to handle wafer, steps and machines with keys being their respective id and value being their Object
